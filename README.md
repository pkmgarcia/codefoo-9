## Introduction
Hi, I'm Patrick Kyle Garcia. I'm currently **pursuing a B.S. Software Engineering degree at San Jos√© State University** and am excited to be **graduating this May**.

I'm applying because I grew up reading IGN and want to give back. As my go-to source for all things gaming, anime, comics, and movies, **browsing IGN has been a part of my daily routine for over the past 15 years-or-so**. As an up-and-coming web developer, it only makes sense that I should apply for Code Foo; **I want to give back to the company that gave me years of entertainment**, and I'm capable of doing so now more than ever.

There are several reasons why I should be picked for Code Foo. I care about the quality of IGN's products since I consume them daily. I'm incredibly passionate about web development and coding; I strive to learn as much as I can everyday. But the biggest reason why I should be picked for Code Foo is because **I'm a team player that aims to not only deliver high quality products, but also help my teammates grow as individuals**. Having honed my soft-skills through various part-time jobs such as being a waiter, and honed my leadership skills by taking roles such as Technical Lead, Project Manager, and Web Development Lead in projects, **I'm well-equipped to foster a team environment that can deliver both a high quality product and a high quality team**. I know that while delivering the product is important, growing your team and its individuals, regardless of your position, is imperative to a successful release.
