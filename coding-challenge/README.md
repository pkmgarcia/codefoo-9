# How Can Geralt of Rivia Get the Most Out of His Armor Purchase?

## NOTICE
**This question has not been answered**. I didn't set aside enough time to really tackle this problem. While I most likely won't be revisiting this problem, the solution to the problem would have been as follows:

* The store is saved in a .csv file
* Uses dynamic programming (strongly resembles the KnapSack problem)
* First filters the items by types, then considers one item of each type every iteration
