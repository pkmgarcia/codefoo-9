# Rooms
A fullstack, chat application with rooms, authentication, and authorization.

## NOTICE
**The application is incomplete**. I just didn't have time to implement it. However, UI wireframes, an Entity Relationship Diagram, and the REST API's documentation are defined. While I was not able to finish the application in time (my fault, I definitely had enough time), **I'll be moving this to another repository and completing it on my own time**. As I set that up, feel free to take a look at the [design](https://github.com/pkmgarcia/codefoo-9/tree/master/fullstack/design) folder for a feel of how the application may end up looking.
