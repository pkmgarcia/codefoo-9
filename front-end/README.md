- Should pull contents and comment counts from the following API: https://ign-apis.herokuapp.com/
- Should match the wireframe as close as possible.
- Should be responsive and support common resolutions from mobile to desktop.


## Usage

1. Clone the repository.

   `git clone https://github.com/pkmgarcia/codefoo-9.git`

2. Open `index.html` in your browser (use the latest version of Google Chrome for best results).

## Commentary

### Why use only jQuery instead of a framework and/or multiple libraries?

It's an odd choice, considering that, based on my experience, web developers from my cohort tend to pick the newer, shinier front end web development frameworks such as [React](https://reactjs.org) or [Angular](https://angular.io). But I chose to use jQuery for a couple of reasons:

1. I want to show that **I can pick up libraries quickly**.
2. I want to show that **I aim to be fluent in all flavors of JavaScript (and not just ES6)**.
3. I want to show that **I understand fundamental, front end development concepts such as the DOM and AJAX**.
